# Product Requirements Document - Iteration 2

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the second iteration of the Rocket application, focusing on establishing real-time communication between the frontend UI and the backend API using WebSockets, with a visual connection status indicator.

## Objectives
- Establish real-time communication architecture between frontend and backend
- Provide clear visual feedback about connection status to users
- Set up the foundation for future real-time features
- Enhance user experience with live connection monitoring

## Feature: WebSocket Connection with Status Panel

### Description
Connect the Vue frontend with the NestJS backend using WebSockets and display a connection status panel beneath the rocket that shows real-time connection information and status.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Backend WebSocket Setup**
   - NestJS WebSocket gateway configured and running
   - WebSocket server accepts connections on dedicated port/endpoint
   - Basic connection/disconnection event handling
   - Health check endpoint for connection status

2. **Frontend WebSocket Integration**
   - Vue service for WebSocket connection management
   - Automatic connection establishment on app load
   - Connection state management (connecting, connected, disconnected, error)
   - Automatic reconnection logic with exponential backoff

3. **Status Panel Display**
   - Information panel positioned below the rocket component
   - Real-time connection status indicator with visual states:
     - **Connecting**: Yellow indicator with "Connecting..." message
     - **Connected**: Green indicator with "Connected" message and connection time
     - **Disconnected**: Red indicator with "Disconnected" message
     - **Error**: Red indicator with "Connection Error" message
   - Connection statistics (uptime, reconnection attempts)

4. **Visual Design Requirements**
   - Panel integrates seamlessly with existing rocket design
   - Consistent color scheme with space theme
   - Responsive design for all device sizes
   - Smooth transitions between status states
   - Non-intrusive but clearly visible

5. **Technical Requirements**
   - Service-based architecture for WebSocket management
   - TypeScript interfaces for connection states and messages
   - Error handling and logging
   - Configurable connection parameters via environment variables
   - Clean separation between UI components and business logic

### Success Metrics
- Connection establishes within 2 seconds under normal conditions
- Reconnection attempts succeed within 10 seconds of network recovery
- Status updates display within 500ms of state changes
- Zero memory leaks from connection management
- Component passes TypeScript compilation with strict mode

### Non-Goals
- Real-time data streaming (save for future iterations)
- User authentication via WebSocket
- Multiple simultaneous connections
- Custom WebSocket protocols beyond standard WebSocket

## Technical Specifications

### Backend Architecture
```
WebSocket Gateway (NestJS)
├── Connection handling
├── Event listeners (connect/disconnect)
├── Health check endpoint
└── Configuration from environment variables
```

### Frontend Architecture
```
WebSocket Service
├── Connection management
├── State tracking
├── Reconnection logic
└── Event emission for UI updates

Status Panel Component
├── Real-time status display
├── Connection statistics
├── Visual state indicators
└── Responsive design
```

### WebSocket Events
- `connection`: Client connects to server
- `disconnect`: Client disconnects from server
- `ping`: Heartbeat for connection health
- `pong`: Heartbeat response

### Connection States
```typescript
type ConnectionState = 
  | 'connecting'
  | 'connected' 
  | 'disconnected'
  | 'error'
  | 'reconnecting'
```

### Environment Configuration
- Backend: `WEBSOCKET_PORT`, `WEBSOCKET_PATH`
- Frontend: `VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL`, `VITE_RECONNECT_INTERVAL`

## Implementation Priority
**High Priority** - Essential infrastructure for real-time features and user experience feedback.

## Dependencies
- NestJS WebSocket support (@nestjs/websockets, @nestjs/platform-socket.io)
- Frontend WebSocket client library
- Vue 3 reactivity system
- TypeScript interfaces
- Environment configuration system

## Timeline
- Backend WebSocket gateway: 1 day
- Frontend WebSocket service: 1 day  
- Status panel component: 1 day
- Integration and testing: 1 day
- Total estimated effort: 4 days

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Network instability**: Implement robust reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- **Performance impact**: Use efficient event handling and avoid excessive re-renders
- **Cross-origin issues**: Configure CORS properly for WebSocket connections
- **Mobile connectivity**: Test reconnection behavior on mobile networks

## Future Considerations
- This foundation enables future features like real-time rocket telemetry, chat systems, or collaborative features
- Status panel can be extended to show additional system information
- Connection pooling for multiple services

# Product Requirements Document - Iteration 1

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the first iteration of the Rocket application, focusing on creating a foundational UI component that displays an animated rocket as the centerpiece of the user interface.

## Objectives
- Establish the visual identity of the application
- Create an engaging, animated centerpiece component
- Set up the foundation for future feature development

## Feature: Animated Rocket Display

### Description
Display a rocket SVG icon in the center of the UI with animated flames to create visual interest and establish the application's space theme.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Rocket SVG Display**
   - Rocket SVG is positioned in the center of the viewport
   - Rocket maintains proper proportions and visibility across different screen sizes
   - SVG is crisp and scalable

2. **Flame Animation**
   - Flames appear at the base of the rocket
   - Animation is smooth and continuous
   - Flame colors use warm tones (orange, red, yellow gradients)
   - Animation performance is optimized (no jank or excessive resource usage)

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Component scales appropriately on mobile, tablet, and desktop
   - Animation performance remains smooth across devices
   - Rocket remains centered regardless of viewport size

4. **Technical Requirements**
   - Implemented as a reusable Vue 3 component using Composition API and TypeScript
   - SVG inline or as a component (no external image files)
   - CSS animations or Vue transitions for flame effects
   - Component follows project naming conventions

### Success Metrics
- Component loads within 100ms
- Animation runs at 60fps on modern devices
- Zero accessibility violations
- Component passes TypeScript compilation

### Non-Goals
- Interactive functionality (clicking, hovering effects)
- Sound effects or audio
- Multiple rocket variations
- User customization options

## Technical Specifications

### Component Structure
```
RocketDisplay.vue
├── Template: SVG rocket with flame elements

- Opacity transitions: 0.3-1.0 range
- Scale variations: 0.8-1.2 range for flame size
- Smooth easing functions (ease-in-out)

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers supporting CSS animations
- Vue 3 compatibility requirements
- Mobile browser optimization

## Implementation Priority
**High Priority** - This is the foundational visual element for the application and establishes the core user experience.

## Dependencies
- Vue 3 framework (already available)
- TypeScript support (configured)
- Modern CSS animation support

## Timeline
- Design and development: 1-2 days
- Testing and refinement: 1 day
- Total estimated effort: 2-3 days

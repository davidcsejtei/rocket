# PRD - Iteration 8: Emergency Shutdown and Auto-Landing System

## Overview
Implement an emergency shutdown system that activates during high-severity anomalies, allowing manual emergency landing initiation with simulated telemetry data during the emergency landing sequence.

## Features

### 1. High Anomaly Emergency Indicator
**Requirement**: Display a prominent emergency shutdown interface when high or critical anomalies are detected.

**Implementation Details**:
- Monitor incoming anomaly alerts for `high` and `critical` severity levels
- Display a red emergency indicator box prominently on the UI
- Include visual warning indicators (red background, warning icons)
- Show emergency shutdown button with clear call-to-action

**Visual Design**:
- Red background with high contrast text
- Warning icon (⚠️ or similar)
- Large, prominent "EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN" button
- Pulsing or flashing animation to draw attention
- Position: Top of screen or overlay for maximum visibility

### 2. Emergency Shutdown Button
**Requirement**: Provide immediate emergency landing capability when button is activated.

**Implementation Details**:
- Single-click activation (no confirmation dialog for speed)
- Immediately stops real telemetry data processing
- Initiates emergency landing sequence
- Changes rocket status to emergency landing mode
- Disables normal mission controls during emergency

**Button States**:
- **Inactive**: Hidden when no high/critical anomalies
- **Active**: Visible and clickable during high anomalies
- **Triggered**: Shows "EMERGENCY LANDING IN PROGRESS" after activation

### 3. Emergency Landing Telemetry Simulation
**Requirement**: API generates realistic telemetry data for emergency landing sequence.

**Implementation Details**:
- Stop processing real Kafka telemetry streams
- Generate simulated telemetry data showing emergency descent
- Calculate realistic emergency landing trajectory
- Show rapid altitude decrease with appropriate deceleration
- Maintain proper physics simulation for emergency landing

**Emergency Landing Parameters**:
- Initial status: `abort` → `descent`
- Rapid altitude reduction (faster than normal descent)
- Increased drag force simulation
- Emergency parachute deployment indicators
- Controlled deceleration to safe landing speeds
- Duration: 30-60 seconds of simulated landing

### 4. Emergency Landing Confirmation
**Requirement**: Show successful emergency landing completion message.

**Implementation Details**:
- Monitor simulated telemetry until altitude reaches ground level (≤ 10m)
- Display success message when emergency landing completes
- Reset emergency state and restore normal operations capability
- Log emergency event for review

**Success Message**:
- "EMERGENCY LANDING SUCCESSFUL"
- Show final landing location
- Display landing impact data
- Option to reset system for new mission

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Changes
1. **New Emergency Component**: `EmergencyShutdown.vue`
   - Monitor anomaly severity levels
   - Display emergency interface
   - Handle shutdown button activation
   - Show emergency landing progress

2. **WebSocket Service Enhancement**:
   - Add emergency mode state management
   - Handle emergency landing simulation requests
   - Process simulated vs real telemetry data
   - Emergency state reset functionality

3. **Telemetry Display Updates**:
   - Show emergency landing indicator during simulation
   - Display simulated data with visual distinction
   - Emergency progress indicators

### Backend Changes
1. **Emergency Landing Endpoint**:
   - `POST /api/emergency/initiate-landing`
   - Stop real telemetry processing
   - Generate emergency landing simulation
   - WebSocket emit simulated telemetry data

2. **Emergency Telemetry Generator**:
   - Physics-based emergency descent simulation
   - Realistic deceleration curves
   - Emergency systems activation indicators
   - Landing sequence progression

3. **Emergency State Management**:
   - Track emergency landing state
   - Handle multiple concurrent emergency scenarios
   - Emergency event logging and audit trail

### Data Flow
1. **Anomaly Detection** → High/Critical anomaly received
2. **UI Activation** → Emergency shutdown interface appears
3. **User Action** → Emergency shutdown button clicked
4. **API Request** → Emergency landing initiation sent to backend
5. **Simulation Start** → Real telemetry stops, simulated data begins
6. **Landing Progress** → Simulated descent with visual feedback
7. **Landing Complete** → Success message and system reset option

## Success Criteria
1. ✅ Emergency interface appears only during high/critical anomalies
2. ✅ Emergency shutdown button immediately stops real data
3. ✅ Simulated emergency landing data displays correctly
4. ✅ Landing sequence completes with success confirmation
5. ✅ System can reset to normal operations after emergency
6. ✅ Emergency events are properly logged
7. ✅ Multiple rockets can handle emergency scenarios independently

## Technical Notes
- Emergency shutdown must be immediate (< 1 second response)
- Simulated telemetry should be visually distinct from real data
- Emergency landing simulation must be realistic and physics-based
- System must handle network failures during emergency scenarios
- All emergency events require audit logging

# PRD - Iteration 8: Emergency Shutdown and Auto-Landing System

## Overview
Implement an emergency shutdown system that activates during high-severity anomalies, allowing manual emergency landing initiation with simulated telemetry data during the emergency landing sequence.

## Features

### 1. High Anomaly Emergency Indicator
**Requirement**: Display a prominent emergency shutdown interface when high or critical anomalies are detected.

**Implementation Details**:
- Monitor incoming anomaly alerts for `high` and `critical` severity levels
- Display a red emergency indicator box prominently on the UI
- Include visual warning indicators (red background, warning icons)
- Show emergency shutdown button with clear call-to-action

**Visual Design**:
- Red background with high contrast text
- Warning icon (⚠️ or similar)
- Compact "EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN" button
- Subtle pulsing animation to draw attention
- Position: Fixed at top of screen, compact size to not obscure content
- Non-overlaying design that pushes page content down slightly

### 2. Emergency Shutdown Button
**Requirement**: Provide immediate emergency landing capability when button is activated.

**Implementation Details**:
- Single-click activation (no confirmation dialog for speed)
- Immediately stops real telemetry data processing
- Initiates emergency landing sequence
- Changes rocket status to emergency landing mode
- Disables normal mission controls during emergency

**Button States**:
- **Inactive**: Hidden when no high/critical anomalies
- **Active**: Visible and clickable during high anomalies
- **Triggered**: Shows "EMERGENCY LANDING IN PROGRESS" after activation

### 3. Emergency Landing Telemetry Simulation
**Requirement**: API generates realistic telemetry data for emergency landing sequence.

**Implementation Details**:
- Stop processing real Kafka telemetry streams
- Generate simulated telemetry data showing emergency descent
- Calculate realistic emergency landing trajectory
- Show rapid altitude decrease with appropriate deceleration
- Maintain proper physics simulation for emergency landing

**Emergency Landing Parameters**:
- Initial status: `abort` → `descent`
- Rapid altitude reduction (faster than normal descent)
- Increased drag force simulation
- Emergency parachute deployment indicators
- Controlled deceleration to safe landing speeds
- Duration: 30-60 seconds of simulated landing

### 4. Emergency Landing Confirmation
**Requirement**: Show successful emergency landing completion message.

**Implementation Details**:
- Monitor simulated telemetry until altitude reaches ground level (≤ 10m)
- Display success message when emergency landing completes
- Reset emergency state and restore normal operations capability
- Log emergency event for review

**Success Message**:
- "EMERGENCY LANDING SUCCESSFUL"
- Show final landing location
- Display landing impact data
- Option to reset system for new mission

### 5. Telemetry Processing Control
**Requirement**: Stop all telemetry data processing when emergency landing is completed.

**Implementation Details**:
- Immediately halt processing of incoming Kafka telemetry streams upon landing completion
- Block all real telemetry data updates to prevent interference with emergency state
- Maintain emergency landing statistics display without new data updates
- Preserve emergency landing completion state until manual reset

**Telemetry Blocking Behavior**:
- All incoming telemetry messages are ignored during emergency completion state
- WebSocket service enters "emergency mode" to prevent data processing
- Console logging shows when telemetry messages are being blocked
- Emergency simulation data remains visible in UI

### 6. Complete System Reset
**Requirement**: Provide comprehensive data cleanup when reset system button is clicked after emergency landing.

**Implementation Details**:
- Clear all telemetry message history and reset message counters
- Remove all anomaly alerts (recent and complete history)
- Reset rocket status to initial "prelaunch" state
- Clear all status change history
- Reset celebration states and milestone tracking
- Restore telemetry processing capability for new missions

**Reset Scope**:
- **Telemetry Data**: All messages, counters, and Kafka status
- **Anomaly Data**: All alerts, history, and anomaly status counters
- **Rocket State**: Status, history, and mission progress
- **UI State**: Emergency component state, landing statistics, timing data
- **System State**: Resume normal telemetry processing and reconnect to data streams

**Fresh Start Guarantee**:
- UI returns to initial state equivalent to application startup
- All reactive data structures are properly cleared
- WebSocket connections remain active but data processing resumes
- System ready to receive and process new mission data immediately

### 7. Quick Landing Acceleration
**Requirement**: Provide option to accelerate emergency landing completion during slow descent scenarios.

**Implementation Details**:
- Add "QUICK LANDING" button during emergency landing progress
- Button only visible during active emergency landing simulation
- Clicking button immediately switches to 10-second landing sequence
- Linear descent calculation to reach ground in exactly 10 seconds
- Maintains emergency landing safety while reducing wait time

**Quick Landing Behavior**:
- Calculates current altitude and divides by 10 seconds for descent rate
- Replaces normal physics simulation with linear descent
- Preserves all emergency landing telemetry data structure
- Shows accelerated descent rate in telemetry display
- Completes with same success message and statistics

**User Experience**:
- Button appears with orange/amber styling to indicate acceleration option
- Button text changes to "QUICK LANDING..." when activated
- No confirmation required for immediate response
- Console logging shows transition to quick landing mode
- All existing emergency completion flows remain unchanged

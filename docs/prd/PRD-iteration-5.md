# PRD - Iteration 5: Mission Success Celebration

## Overview
Add a celebration popup feature that triggers when the rocket reaches the final target altitude of 101,445m, providing visual feedback for mission success and enhancing user engagement.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Celebration popup appears when altitude reaches exactly 101,445m
- [ ] Popup includes congratulatory message and visual effects
- [ ] Popup can be dismissed by user interaction
- [ ] Feature works consistently across all device sizes
- [ ] Celebration only triggers once per mission

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Altitude Monitoring
- System continuously monitors incoming telemetry altitude values
- Triggers celebration when altitude >= 101,445m
- Prevents multiple celebrations for the same mission/rocket

### FR-2: Celebration Popup
- **Content Requirements:**
  - Congratulatory headline: "ðŸš€ MISSION SUCCESS! ðŸŽ‰"
  - Achievement message: "Rocket has reached the target altitude!"
  - Altitude display: "Final Altitude: 101,445m"
  - Rocket ID and mission time
  - Visual celebration elements (confetti, animations)

### FR-3: User Interaction
- Popup includes "Celebrate!" button to dismiss
- Click outside popup area also dismisses
- Escape key closes popup
- Auto-dismiss after 10 seconds if no interaction

### FR-4: Visual Design
- **Popup Styling:**
  - Large, centered modal overlay
  - Gradient background (rocket theme colors)
  - Animated confetti or particle effects
  - Rocket emoji and celebration icons
  - Smooth fade-in/fade-out animations

### FR-5: State Management
- Track which rockets/missions have already celebrated
- Reset celebration state on new mission start
- Store celebration history for session

## Technical Requirements

### TR-1: Frontend Implementation
- Create `CelebrationPopup.vue` component
- Add altitude monitoring logic to telemetry service
- Implement celebration state management
- Add CSS animations and visual effects

### TR-2: Telemetry Integration
- Monitor `altitude` field from telemetry messages
- Trigger celebration on threshold reached
- Handle edge cases (altitude fluctuations, multiple messages)

### TR-3: Performance
- Lightweight popup rendering
- Smooth animations (60fps target)
- Minimal impact on real-time telemetry display

### TR-4: Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatible
- Respects reduced motion preferences
- High contrast mode support

## User Stories

### US-1: Mission Success
**As a** user monitoring rocket telemetry  
**I want** to see a celebration when the rocket reaches its target altitude  
**So that** I can clearly recognize mission success and feel engaged with the achievement

### US-2: Clear Achievement Feedback
**As a** user  
**I want** to see the exact altitude and mission details in the celebration  
**So that** I can understand what milestone was reached

### US-3: Non-Intrusive Celebration
**As a** user  
**I want** to easily dismiss the celebration popup  
**So that** I can continue monitoring telemetry data if needed

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Altitude Trigger
- **Given** telemetry data is flowing
- **When** altitude reaches or exceeds 101,445m
- **Then** celebration popup appears immediately

### AC-2: Popup Content
- **Given** celebration popup is displayed
- **When** user views the popup
- **Then** it shows congratulatory message, final altitude, rocket ID, and mission time

### AC-3: Visual Effects
- **Given** celebration popup appears
- **When** popup is displayed
- **Then** it includes animated visual effects (confetti, smooth transitions)

### AC-4: Dismissal
- **Given** celebration popup is visible
- **When** user clicks "Celebrate!" button, clicks outside, or presses Escape
- **Then** popup dismisses with smooth fade-out animation

### AC-5: Single Celebration
- **Given** rocket has already reached 101,445m
- **When** altitude continues above this threshold
- **Then** no additional celebration popups appear

### AC-6: Responsive Design
- **Given** celebration popup is displayed
- **When** viewed on different screen sizes
- **Then** popup adapts appropriately and remains centered

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Component
1. Create `CelebrationPopup.vue` component
2. Implement basic popup modal functionality
3. Add celebration content and styling
4. Integrate with telemetry service

### Phase 2: Visual Effects
1. Add CSS animations for popup transitions
2. Implement confetti or particle effects
3. Add celebration sound effects (optional)
4. Polish visual design and responsiveness

### Phase 3: State Management
1. Implement celebration state tracking
2. Add mission/rocket-specific celebration logic
3. Handle edge cases and error scenarios
4. Add accessibility features

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish
1. Test across different screen sizes
2. Verify accessibility compliance
3. Performance testing with continuous telemetry
4. User experience refinements

## Technical Notes

### Altitude Threshold
- Target altitude: **101,445m** (exactly)
- Trigger condition: `altitude >= 101445`
- Consider floating-point precision in comparisons

### Animation Libraries
- Use CSS animations for performance
- Consider libraries like `animate.css` for effects
- Implement confetti using canvas or CSS particles

### State Persistence
- Session-based celebration tracking
- Reset on page refresh/new mission
- Store in component state or Pinia store

### Performance Considerations
- Debounce altitude checks to prevent excessive triggers
- Optimize animation performance
- Lazy load celebration assets

## Dependencies
- Existing telemetry monitoring system
- Vue 3 Composition API
- CSS animation capabilities
- Telemetry service integration

## Success Metrics
- Celebration triggers accurately at 101,445m altitude
- Smooth animations (>= 30fps)
- Popup dismisses reliably
- Zero impact on telemetry monitoring performance
- Positive user engagement with celebration feature

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- Multiple milestone celebrations
- Custom celebration messages
- Achievement badges system
- Social sharing of mission success
- Celebration statistics and history
- Audio celebration effects
- Reset celebration functionality for testing
